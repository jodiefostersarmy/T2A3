This man worked for a carnival you dig, and to start with it was like a novelty ventriliquist act. Real funny, too, at first. He had a number he called \u201cThe Better \u2018Ole\u201d that was a scream, I tell you. I forget most of it but it was clever. Like, \u201cOh I say, are you still down there, old thing?\u201d \u201cNah I had to go relieve myself.\u201d Then it developed sort of teeth-like little raspy in-curving hooks and started eating. He thought this was cute at first and built an act around it, but the asshole would eat its way through his pants and start talking on the street, shouting out it wanted equal rights. It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags nobody loved it and it wanted to be kissed same as any other mouth. Finally it talked all the time day and night, you could hear him for blocks screaming at it to shut up, and beating it with his fist, and sticking candles up it, but nothing did any good and the asshole said to him: \u201cIt\u2019s you who will shut up in the end. Not me. Because we dont need you around here any more. I can talk and eat and shit.\u201d After that he began waking up in the morning with a transparent jelly like a tadpole\u2019s tail all over his mouth. This jelly was what the scientists call un-D.T., Undifferentiated Tissue, which can grow into any kind of flesh on the human body. He would tear it off his mouth and the pieces would stick to his hands like burning gasoline jelly and grow there, grow anywhere on him a glob of it fell. So finally his mouth sealed over, and the whole head would have have amputated spontaneous \u2014 (did you know there is a condition occurs in parts of Africa and only among Negroes where the little toe amputates spontaneously?) \u2014 except for the eyes you dig. Thats one thing the asshole couldn\u2019t do was see. It needed the eyes. But nerve connections were blocked and infiltrated and atrophied so the brain couldn\u2019t give orders any more. It was trapped in the skull, sealed off. For a while you could see the silent, helpless suffering of the brain behind the eyes, then finally the brain must have died, because the eyes went out, and there was no more feeling in them than a crab\u2019s eyes on the end of a stalk.\u201d ", "author": "William S.
